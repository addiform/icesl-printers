# Klipper Configurable Printer Profile for IceSL (n8Klipper, based off of Addiform_RRF)
- [x] Created on 2020-JUL-20 by Nathan Buxton
- [ ] Support for absolute extrusion coming in v1.1

### n8Klipper adds the following features:
- Support for firmware retraction.
- Support for relative extrusion.
- Klipper-specific GCode output.
- Toolpath visualization compatibility for S3D and CraftWare.

## IceSL is a state of the art slicer (STL → G-code) with advanced modeling capabilities.
### IceSL has the following novel slicing features, and more:
- Variable layer-height optimization.
- Robust multi-tool support.
- Active temperature control, which ensures tools are heated and cooled just in time for their use.
- Geometry-based print setting modifiers.
- Paint to specify seam locations.
- Advanced tree-like support structures.
- Supports based on toolpaths, not only meshes.
- Paint to block supports.
- Hollow prints with self-supporting cavities.
- Advanced and experimental infill options:
  - Progressive infill patterns that can smoothly vary in density along height.
  - Cubic, Tetrahedral and Hierarchical infills.
  - Ability to create [custom infill types](https://github.com/shapeforge/icesl-infillers/blob/master/README.md).
- High-precision slicing with controllable simplification.
- Minimum layer time, with customizable wait GCode.

## Using this printer profile:

n8Klipper is a template for you to create a profile specific to your printer running ~~RepRapFirmware~~ Klipper. You should first make a copy of the `../n8Klipper/` directory and rename it for your printer, so that updates to the n8Klipper profile template do not overwrite your changes.

### IceSL printer profiles are made up of several components:
- `printer.lua` -- functions that produce GCode output
- `features.lua` -- printer parameters and default settings
- `profiles/*.lua` --  optional print parameters for different scenarios
- `materials/*.lua` -- optional print parameters for different materials
- `*.g` or `*.gcode` -- templates for insertion into final GCode

>***Note: The file `printer.lua` is not intended to be modified by the user, unless to implement new features, fix bugs, or modify behaviour. Refer to `features.lua` for user-configurable printer parameters.***

#### IceSL gives priority to an assignment of print settings according to the following list:
1. Default IceSL values -- bottom priority
2. Printer features (`features.lua`)
3. Print profile (e.g., fast print, high quality, etc.)
4. Material profile (e.g., abs, pla, etc.)
5. Lua script (user-made script loaded into IceSL for modelling and other purposes)
6. Graphical User Interface (GUI) -- top priority

## Print Profiles: `profiles/*.lua`
Print profiles are optional, can be created for different scenarios, and can be named anything the user wishes. A profile might be created for high quality settings, fast print settings, or settings for a specific type of job like miniatures or lithophanes. These pre-made profiles are selectable by a dropdown in the IceSL GUI.

They contain the name of the profile in different regional languages and any variable assignments to the desired values.

```lua
-- file: /profiles/high.lua
name_en = "High Quality"
name_es = "Calidad Alta"
name_fr = "Haute Qualité"
name_ch = "高质量"

-- This is only an example.
z_layer_height_mm = 0.05
print_speed_mm_per_sec = 30
```
## Material Profiles: `materials/*.lua`
Material profiles are optional and can be created to supplement the above-mentioned print profiles. These pre-made profiles are selectable by a dropdown in the IceSL GUI.

They contain the name of the material in different regional languages and any variable assignments to the desired values.

```lua
-- file: /materials/pla.lua
name_en = "PLA"
name_es = "PLA"
name_fr = "PLA"
name_ch = "PLA"

-- This is only an example.
extruder_temp_degree_c = 180
```

>**Note: The user may modify settings defined in pre-made `*.lua` profiles from within the IceSL GUI, but they can not save back directly to the pre-made profiles. Instead, they can save custom settings to XML files within the IceSL GUI.<br/><br/>If no print or material profiles are present, the 'Custom' profile will be used by default, which merely inherits all defaults from IceSL and `features.lua`.**

## GCode Insertion Templates: `start.g`, `wait.g`, `end.g`, ...
These GCode files can optionally be automatically inserted into final GCode output during specific print operations. They can contain any GCode the user wishes. There are variables which can be passed through to the GCode production process, allowing for print settings to be passed to the templates.

The file `wait.g` is inserted in order to achieve a minimum layer time when 'Enable minimum printing time for layers' is enabled and 'Function 'wait'' is selected as the method.

## Printer Features: `features.lua`
IceSL provides default values for all of the settings of its built-in features. In `features.lua`, these defaults can be changed.

n8Klipper’s `features.lua` template provides a list of all settings/variables that can be set through `features.lua`, the IceSL GUI, Lua scripts, print profiles and/or material presets. This is only for convenience. None of the native IceSL settings need to be in `features.lua`, unless to change the default values for your printer.

>***Note: The template `features.lua` also contains additional settings/variables for features added by n8Klipper. These variables must all remain initialized in `features.lua`, but can be changed to have different starting values.***
